# Building
Project is managed with CMake, so in order to build you need to do the following

## Setup
Follow the instructions in the root readme to install the NVidia toolchain on the computer.

**Note:** Make sure you install the toolchain to your home directory under pgccSDK. CMake assumes the compiler is available under `~/pgccSDK/Linux_x86_64/22.7/compilers/bin/`.

## Building
To build perform the following steps in this directory:
1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake .. -DACCELERATION_TYPE:STRING=<type>` with `<type>` being replaced by one of the following values
  - NO_ACCEL - Do not do any acceleration. This is equivalent to `gcc -O3 -o no_accel_picture_kmeans`
  - THREADED - Perform threaded acceleration. This is equivalent to `pgcc -O3 -acc -ta=multicore -Minfo=accel -o threaded_picture_kmeans`
  - GPU - Perform GPU acceleration. This is equivalent to `pgcc -O3 -acc -ta=tesla:cc35,nofma -Minfo=accel -o gpu_accel_picture_kmeans`
4. Execute the binary you created. The resultant binary will change based on the type of acceleration you provided.
